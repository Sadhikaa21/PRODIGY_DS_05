3.The year 2022 seems to have contributed to most of the accidents.

4.The severity level of most accidents is 2.

5.Fair weather conditions account to more accidents.
## Conclusion:
Analyzing traffic accident data provides critical insights into road safety dynamics, emphasizing the impact of road conditions, weather variations, and time-related factors on accident occurrences. These findings can guide policymakers, urban planners, and law enforcement in implementing targeted measures to reduce accident rates and enhance overall road safety.
